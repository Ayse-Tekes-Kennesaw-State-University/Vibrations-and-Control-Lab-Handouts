# Vibrations and Control Lab Handouts
Although there will be more labs added, I created 10 fundamentaals laboratory handouts for undergraduate Vibrations and Control Theory laboratories. The lab handouts are written in MATLAB Live Editor.
- Since we utilize ECP Model 210 (Rectilinear Vibratory Mechanism), ECP Model 205 (Rotational Vibratory System), and Quanser Qube in our vibraations and control lab (ME 4501) at Kennesaw State University, the lab handouts include activities associated with those lab equipment.
- Please download the [translational and rotational virtual lab](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/111285-translational-and-rotational-vibrations-virtual-lab) since there are some activities designed using the virtual lab.

#### Lab Handouts
The fundamentals covered in the lab handouts are:
- Lab 1: Introduction to MATLAB
- Lab 2: SDOF Translational Free Vibrations and System Identification
- Lab 3: SDOF Rotational Free Vibrations and System Identification
- Lab 4: MATLAB Practice for Control Theory
- Lab 5: Mode shapes of a 2DOF system both using ECP 210 and Translational and Rotational Virtual Lab
- Lab 6: Forced Vibrations
- Lab 7: Vibration Isolator Design both using ECP 210 and Translational and Rotational Virtual Lab
- Lab 8: Quanser Qube Block Diagram Modeling
- Lab 9: Modeling of a First Order System using Quanser Qube
- Lab 10: PD control design

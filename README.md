# Vibrations and Control Lab Handouts
Although there will be more labs added, I created 10 fundamentaals laboratory handouts for undergraduate Vibrations and Control Theory laboratories. The lab handouts are written in MATLAB Live Editor.
- Since we have ECP Model 210 (Rectilinear Vibratory Mechanism), ECP Model 205 (Rotational Vibratory System), and Quanser Qube, the lab handouts include activities associated with those lab equipment.
- Please download the [translational and rotational virtual lab](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/111285-translational-and-rotational-vibrations-virtual-lab) since there are some activities designed using the virtual lab.
